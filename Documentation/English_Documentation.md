# 1. Installation <a name="installation-title"></a>
## 1.1 Downloading <a name="downloading"></a>

To install the KNX Virtual Integrator application, download the installer [KNX_VI-Installer_vX.X.exe](https://github.com/noecail/UCRM-KNXVirtualIntegrator_2025/releases) from the latest stable release in this GitHub repository.  
The latest version is identified by "Latest" and is usually the highest in the list.

## 1.2 Installing <a name="installing"></a>

To install and launch the application, please follow these steps:

1. **Run the installer**

   Double-click the file `KNX_VI-Installer_vX.X.exe` to launch the installation wizard.

2. **Bypass the “Windows protected your PC” message**

   When the message “Windows protected your PC” appears:

    * Click **"More info"**.
    * Then click **"Run anyway"**.<br>

   > **Note:** **_This does not mean the application is dangerous._**  
   > This message is generated by **Microsoft Defender SmartScreen**, a built-in Windows security component.  
   > It appears when you try to run an application downloaded from the Internet that is not yet recognized by Microsoft.  
   > It does not mean the application is dangerous, only that it hasn’t been widely downloaded and verified yet.

3. **Allow changes**

   If the system displays a User Account Control (UAC) prompt, click **"Yes"** to allow the app to make changes to your device.

4. **Select the language**

   Choose the installation language from the drop-down menu and click **"OK"**.

5. **Select the application folder**

   The installer will ask where to store the application documents.  
   Changing this folder may cause deletion or modification of important files on the computer since the app removes any non-related files in that directory.  
   It is therefore recommended not to change the default folder.  
   Click **Next** then **Next**.

6. **Create a desktop icon**

   Check the box **"Create a Desktop icon"** if you want a shortcut for KNX Virtual Integrator on your Desktop. Click **"Next"** to continue.

7. **Ready to install**

   A summary window will appear, click **"Install"** to begin installation.

8. **Installation completed**

   Once the installation is finished, you will see a confirmation window.  
   Check **"Run KNX Virtual Integrator"** if you want to launch the app immediately, then click **"Finish"**.

# 2. Application Overview <a name="overview-title"></a>
## 2.1. 🪟 Main Window <a name="main-window"></a>

The main window is composed of 5 main sections:

<img src="Images/MainWindow.png" alt="main-window" style="width:90%;"/>

**1. Top Toolbar:**

In this toolbar, you can:
- ⚙️ [Modify application settings](#modify-settings) with the ⚙️ button.
- 📥 [Import KNX group addresses](#ets-import) by clicking on “**Import addresses**”.
- 📥 [Import an ETS project](#ets-import) by clicking on “**Import project**”.
- 📥 [Run installation analysis](#launch-test) by opening the [Analysis Window](#analysis-window) with the “**Test Settings**” button.
- 📤 [Export analysis report](#create-report) by opening the [Report Window](#report-window) with the “**Export report**” button.

**2. First column for Structures:**

Once imported or created, your test structures dictionary appears here.</br>
You can import/export this dictionary and all created models with the buttons at the top right, in order to save your project, for example.</br>
Below, the list of created structures is displayed. They can be selected and edited using the bottom toolbar.</br>
The bottom toolbar has 3 buttons: “**New Structure**”, a pencil to edit the selected structure, and a trash bin to delete checked structures.</br>
The first and second buttons open the [Structure Editing Window](#structure-window).</br>
Warning ! “Selected” means the rectangle changes color, while “Checked” means a tick mark appears in the square next to the structure name.

**3. Second column for Models:**

This column displays the models once imported or created.  
Only the list for the selected structure appears.</br>
You can select, check to delete, or add models.</br>
The bottom toolbar has 2 buttons: “**Create Functional Model**” and a trash bin to delete checked models.</br>
The first button adds a new model in the usual structure form but without addresses or sometimes values.</br>
**Note:** “Selected” means the rectangle changes color, while “Checked” means a tick mark appears in the square next to the model name.

**4. Third column for Test Elements:**

This column displays the test elements of the selected model.  
Here you can rename the model in the “Name:” box, modify group addresses associated with send/receive elements, and adjust values.</br>
You can increase/decrease the number of values to send/receive as well as modify them.</br>
Values should be integers, preferably positive. Avoid **-1** for now as it disables the send value.</br>
Each value has two buttons: top to disable (ignore on receive), bottom to re-enable or reset to 0.</br>
The “**-**” button removes a row of values, while “**+**” adds one.</br>

It is not possible to disable send values.

**5. Fourth column – Group Addresses:**

This column shows the group addresses of the imported project and their DPT.</br>
This display only works when clicking “**Import addresses**” or “**Import project**”.</br>
If you want to refresh addresses after modifying the dictionary or models without overwriting changes: save the dictionary (see first column), import addresses/project, then re-import the saved dictionary if unwanted changes occurred.

## 2.2. Settings Menu <a name="settings-window"></a>

# 4. FAQ <a name="faq-title"></a>

**Why can’t the app be installed for all users at once?**</br>
Most likely due to folder, permission, and registry key issues,  
the app may fail to launch when installed outside the user’s AppData folder.
